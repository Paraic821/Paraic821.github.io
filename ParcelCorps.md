**About this project:** I joined this project one year before release and worked as one of two programmers to shepherd the game to launch.

I worked as a generalist programmer and got to touch on many different areas of the game. I was responisble for maintaing the stability of the project, dealing with bugs as they were reported and also implemented several game modes including a time trial mission, micro deliveries mission and a tricks rush mission. I finished many systems that were partially complete, including the Strift gamemode, leprechaun minigame, player customisation, keyboard controls and much more.
