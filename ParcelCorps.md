## Parcel Corps - Releasing September 3rd

This project began as a piece of coursework exploring video game graphics technology at a postgraduate level. I achieved a grade of 70% for this piece of coursework. After submission, I continued to expand the project, adding SSAO to the scene.

**About this project:** The purpose of this module was to implement graphics techniques through direct calls to the OpenGL API, rather than through a game engine. It covered topics from rendering single triangles, all the way up to lighting, shadowing, post processing and deferred rendering.

The piece of coursework that I created highlights a heightmap generated from perlin noise, normal maps, blended textures, an animated skinned mesh, cubemap reflections and screen space ambient occlusion among other things.

During this project I gained experience in graphics debugging using RenderDoc.

The screen space ambient occlusion can be subtle in this scene, so I've included a screenshot of just the output from the SSAO shader.
