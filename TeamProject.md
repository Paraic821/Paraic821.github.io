## 2023 Team Project: Splat Genius 

This was a major final year team project I completed with 7 other masters students and achieved a first class grade of 79%. For this project we created a multiplayer shooter inspired by Splatoon for both PC and PS4.

I took on the role of lead PlayStation 4 developer and gained experience in cross platform development and working with a PlayStation 4 development kit. In addition to this contribution, I developed and enhanced my pathfinding and screen space ambient occlusion solutions from previous projects to work in this game.
