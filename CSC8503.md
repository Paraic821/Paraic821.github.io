## 2022 Advanced Game Technologies Coursework: Goat Game

This project start life as a piece of coursework exploring video game physics and AI technology at a postgraduate level. I have since expanded upon this project, refining the implementation of A* and string pulling for nav mesh pathfinding and the enemy AI.

**About this project:** This is a simple physics sandbox in which the goal is to destroy a set number of objects and collect points within a time limit. The goat has the ability to headbutt, which will launch nearby objects and destroy destructible objects.

This module's coursework is built upon a simple physics codebase provided by the lecturer. Based off information provided in taught materials, I was to implement systems for the application of forces and impulses, collision detection, collision resolution, constraints, spacial acceleration structures, game states, and AI. 

Additionally I independently implemented some more advanced features, such as custom capsule collision detection, and A* pathfinding and a string pulling algorithm for pathfinding using a nav mesh.
