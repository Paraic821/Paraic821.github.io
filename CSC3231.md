**About this project:** The goal of this coursework was to implement some fundamental graphics techniques using Unity's tools. The key areas of focus were simple lighting and shadows, terrain generation, blended textures, scene graph management and programmatic animations.

I implemented some additional features, such as particles, lens flares and a custom made water shader.
