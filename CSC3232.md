**About this project:** The goal of this game is to complete a series of levels by defeating enemies and performing simple platforming. The core mechanic is the harpoon, which can be used as a grappling hook to traverse levels and also to pull pieces of armour off enemies. Once armour is pulled off, the player can throw it back at enemies to deal damage. Damage is based on the weight of the thrown object and how much armour the enemy is still wearing.

A video of a short playthrough of the game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZayxCJY1Ows). This project was never updated after coursework submission, so you may notice a few rough edges.
