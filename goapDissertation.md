## 2023 Project: Implementing Goal Oriented Action Planning for Complex AI Entity Behaviour in Video Games

**About this project:** This was a smaller project for the final year, following on from the 2022 dissertation on ray tracing. For this project, I elected to explore the field of goal oriented action planning (GOAP) in order to gain experience in working with more complex AI behaviour than I had encountered in previous projects. 

I implemented my own GOAP system in C++ in Unreal Engine 5. An additional reason for choosing this project was to gain experience using UE5 as it is a powerful tool and has almost become an industry standard in recent years.
