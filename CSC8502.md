## 2022 Advanced Graphics for Games Coursework

This project began as a piece of coursework exploring video game graphics technology at a postgraduate level. I achieved a grade of 70% for this piece of coursework. After submission, I continued to expand the project, adding SSAO to the scene.

**About this project:** The screen space ambient occlusion can be subtle in this scene, so I've included a screenshot of just the output from the SSAO shader.
